// to help you answer these questions

// Questions

// a) When formatTimeDisplay is called how many times will pad be called?
// =============> write your answer here
//3 times.

// Call formatTimeDisplay with an input of 61, now answer the following:

// b) What is the value assigned to num when pad is called for the first time?
// =============> write your answer here
//Ther value is 0.

// c) What is the return value of pad when it is called for the first time?
// =============> write your answer here
// The value is "00".

// d) What is the value assigned to num when pad is called for the last time in this program?  Explain your answer
// =============> write your answer here
//The value is "1" — last call is pad(remainingSeconds), and for 61 seconds that is 1.

// e) What is the return value of pad when it is called for the last time in this program?  Explain your answer
// =============> write your answer here
//The value is ""01" — pad turns 1 into a two-digit string.
